# Flood-Detection
using Raspberry pi

This project is a real-time flood detection and alert system using a Raspberry Pi, ultrasonic sensor, rain sensor, DHT11 temperature and humidity sensor, buzzer, LEDs, and an LCD display. It sends SMS alerts using Twilio and logs data to a MySQL database and ThingSpeak.

Features
Measures water level using an ultrasonic sensor.
Monitors rainfall using a rain sensor.
Reads temperature and humidity using a DHT11 sensor.
Visual indication using Green, Yellow, and Red LEDs.
Audible buzzer alert in critical conditions.
Sends emergency SMS alerts using Twilio.
Logs sensor data into a MySQL database.
Sends sensor data to ThingSpeak cloud.

Hardware Components
Raspberry Pi, Ultrasonic Sensor (HC-SR04), Rain Sensor (YL-83 with MCP3008 ADC), DHT11 Temperature & Humidity Sensor, Buzzer, LEDs (Green, Yellow, Red), 16x2 LCD Display, MCP3008 ADC (for analog input), Jumper wires, Breadboard

Software Requirements
Python 3, RPi.GPIO, Adafruit_DHT library, Adafruit_CharLCD library, spidev library, MySQL Connector, Twilio library, Requests library

Setup Instructions
1) Wire all sensors and components as per the pin configuration in the code.
  
2) Install required Python libraries:
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install python3-pip
pip3 install RPi.GPIO Adafruit_DHT mysql-connector-python twilio requests spidev

3) Setup MySQL database with a table sensor_data:
CREATE DATABASE flood_detection;
USE flood_detection;
CREATE TABLE sensor_data (
    id INT AUTO_INCREMENT PRIMARY KEY,
    temperature FLOAT,
    humidity FLOAT,
    distance FLOAT,
    rain_status VARCHAR(20),
    led_status INT,
    timestamp TIMESTAMP DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP
);

4) Replace placeholders in the code:
Twilio ACCOUNT_SID, AUTH_TOKEN, TWILIO_PHONE_NUMBER, TO_PHONE_NUMBER
ThingSpeak THINGSPEAK_WRITE_API_KEY
Database password in DB_CONFIG

5) Run the program:
python3 flood_detection.py

Working:
1) Ultrasonic sensor measures the distance to water.
2) Rain sensor detects rain intensity.
3) DHT11 measures temperature and humidity.
4) LEDs indicate water level:
    Green: Safe (> 7 cm)
    Yellow: Caution (4-7 cm)
    Red: Danger (< 4 cm)
5) Buzzer and SMS alert on critical water level.
6) Data is stored in MySQL and sent to ThingSpeak.
